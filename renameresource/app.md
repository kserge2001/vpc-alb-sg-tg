## 1. Introduction to Python

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for DevOps engineers to automate tasks, manage infrastructure, and interact with APIs.

## 2. Setting Up Python

### Installation

*   **Linux:** Python is usually pre-installed. You can install it using:

```
sudo apt-get install python3
```
# Setting Up Python

*   **Windows:** Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
```

## 3. Basic Python Syntax

### Hello World

```
print("Hello, World!")
```
### Comment 

```
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
```
## 4. Variables and Data Types

### Variables

```
name = "DevOps Engineer"
experience = 5
is_certified = True
```

### Data Types

```
# String
name = "John Doe"

# Integer
age = 30

# Float
salary = 75000.50

# Boolean
is_employed = True

# List
skills = ["Python", "Docker", "Kubernetes"]

# Tuple
certifications = ("AWS", "Azure", "GCP")

# Dictionary
employee = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "skills": ["Python", "Docker"]
}
```
### Methods for Each Data Type

#### String Methods

```
text = "DevOps Engineer"
print(text.upper())  # DEVOPS ENGINEER
print(text.lower())  # devops engineer
print(text.replace("Engineer", "Specialist"))  # DevOps Specialist
print(text.split(" "))  # ['DevOps', 'Engineer']
```
